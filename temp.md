A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing
networked applications. It's a set of principles or constraints that guide how web services communicate.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **REST (Representational State Transfer):** This is an architectural style, not a protocol. It was defined by Roy
Fielding in his 2000 Ph.D. dissertation. It's built on top of the HTTP protocol.

2. **API (Application Programming Interface):** This is a set of definitions and protocols that allow different software
applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.

**In essence, a REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate over HTTP in a standard, stateless manner,
typically using JSON or XML data formats.**

**Core Principles/Constraints of REST APIs:**

* **Client-Server Architecture:** There's a clear separation of concerns between the client (who initiates requests) and
the server (who processes requests and sends responses). This separation allows independent evolution of client and
server.
* **Statelessness:** Each request from client to server must contain all the information necessary to understand the
request. The server should not store any client context between requests. This makes the API more scalable and reliable.
* **Cacheability:** Responses from the server should explicitly or implicitly define themselves as cacheable or
non-cacheable. This helps prevent clients from making unnecessary requests and improves performance.
* **Uniform Interface:** This is the most crucial constraint. It simplifies the overall system architecture by ensuring
that all components interact in a standardized way. It has four sub-constraints:
* **Identification of Resources:** Resources (e.g., a user, a product, an order) are identified by unique URIs (Uniform
Resource Identifiers).
* **Manipulation of Resources Through Representations:** Clients manipulate resources using representations (e.g., a
JSON object) of the resource. When a client requests a resource, the server sends a representation of the resource's
current state.
* **Self-Descriptive Messages:** Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message. For
example, the `Content-Type` header tells the client how to parse the message body.
* **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS):** Resources should include links to other related
resources, guiding the client on what actions are possible next. This is often the least implemented constraint in
practice.
* **Layered System (Optional):** A client typically cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to
an intermediary server along the way. This allows for things like load balancers, proxies, and caching servers to be
introduced.
* **Code-On-Demand (Optional):** Servers can temporarily extend or customize client functionality by transferring
executable code (e.g., JavaScript applets). This is rarely used in typical REST APIs.

**How REST APIs Work (Example):**

Imagine you have an API for managing a list of `books`.

* **Resources:** `books` and individual `book`
* **URIs:** `/books` (for all books), `/books/123` (for a specific book with ID 123)
* **HTTP Methods (Verbs):**
* **GET:** Retrieve a resource (e.g., `GET /books` to get all books, `GET /books/123` to get book 123).
* **POST:** Create a new resource (e.g., `POST /books` with a JSON body representing a new book).
* **PUT:** Update an existing resource completely (e.g., `PUT /books/123` with a JSON body containing the *entire*
updated book 123).
* **PATCH:** Partially update an existing resource (e.g., `PATCH /books/123` with a JSON body containing only the fields
to update).
* **DELETE:** Remove a resource (e.g., `DELETE /books/123`).
* **Representations:** Data is typically exchanged in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML format.

**Why are REST APIs so popular?**

* **Simplicity:** They are relatively simple to understand and implement compared to other architectural styles (like
SOAP).
* **Scalability:** The stateless nature and cacheability make them highly scalable.
* **Flexibility:** They are not tied to any specific programming language or platform.
* **Browser Compatibility:** Built on HTTP, they leverage existing web infrastructure.

In summary, a REST API provides a standardized, efficient, and scalable way for different systems to communicate over
the web, making them the most common choice for building web services today.
